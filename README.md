## Inspiration
Is green menstruation possible? A rising quality of life, and high rates of resource consumption patterns have had an unintended and negative impact on the environment - generation of wastes far beyond the handling capacities of existing waste management systems. It’s time to rethink at least some of the “wastes” - sanitary pads.

## What it does
Our app aids a social platform where women can interact, organize and participate in technical as well as non-technical events and earn cash prizes along with menstrual cups, and eco friendly products, making them aware of eco friendly culture and to inspire the rest of the people. Besides, our e-commerce digital service gives opportunities for women to bring out homemade eco-friendly products to market, thereby paving a step in women empowerment. Apart from selling products, the users can donate cups to the needy, in conjunction with this our app to ensure the circulation of eco-friendly products among people.

## How we built it
First, through various brainstorming and online meetings we gave our idea a basic structure. Then we divided the work among each other, some dealt with the UI, some coding part, some creating website, some writing the contents. We used the live share feature in VScode to work together. We made a team project in Figma so that all could work on it and make necessary changes. We used Google Meet for brainstorming and meetings. Constant Communication made this project possible.

## Challenges we ran into
About 121 million out of 336 million menstruating women in India, a total of 36%, are using the sanitary non-biodegradable pads resulting in 113,000 tones of waste per annum. Out of which 28% of waste, if burnt in unsafe conditions, result in the release of highly carcinogenic gases like furan, dioxin, biphenyls thereby causing environmental pollution. And the remaining waste, buried in soil takes about 500-800 years to decompose causing water pollution, reduced soil fertility, noxious odors etc. in regard with these climatic issues , the necessity of menstrual cups over the sanitary pads is crucial, both medically and economically. And even bacterial infections can be averted to a great extent. Moreover the scavengers working out there lack proper scientific equipment and traditional workers are not well aware of these.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We could create awareness among people about the negative impact of sanitary pads and helping them switch to Menstrual cup, thereby making GREEN MENSTRUATION possible.

## What we learned
We understood the huge negative impact , the sanitary pad creating on the environment. Additionally, we learned basics of Flutter ,Dart, Figma, HTML, CSS.
